def merge_sort(input_list):
    """
    Divide-and-conquer algorithm, creates smaller sub-problems using recursion.

    A list is broken down into smaller and smaller lists until there are lists of length one. We can consider lists of length one sorted.

    Merge the sorted lists back together to get the fully sorted list.

    Time Complexity: O(n log n)
        - log n divides to create the single element sorted lists
        - n merges to create the final sorted list

    Stable: Yes
        - logical ordering will be maintained

    Memory: O(n)
        - all the smaller lists we create in the divide phase

    Adaptivity: No
        - Merge Sort doesn't know at any point whether the list is already sorted and will always go through the entire recursive call

    Notes:
        - use Merge Sort when you need speed and have the resources for the memory overhead
